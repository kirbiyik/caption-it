# caption-it
*NOTE: Deployment of ML models has been evolved a lot. At the time this projects is created, there were no(or very little) guidelines for deploying a Pytorch model properly. The methods might be outdated. Use this project only conceptually.*

Training
- Clone repository
- Download dataset with `src/download_dataset.sh`
- Preprocess with `src/build_vocab.py` and `src/resize.py`
- Train model giving appropriate arguments with `src/train.py`
  

Prediction
- Make a nginx configuration to run Flask app. This part can be tricky. [See this link for further.](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-serve-flask-applications-with-uwsgi-and-nginx-on-ubuntu-16-04)
